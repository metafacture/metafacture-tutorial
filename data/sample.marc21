As conversion mission, the Khazar mission is commonly regarded as a failure, whereas the Moravian mission is regarded as a success that paved the way for the spread of Christianity through the Slavic language. For the ultimate results of the Cyrillo-Methodian endeavor, one must go beyond Moravia, because when Methodius died in 885, his disciples were expelled. Methodius could not continue teaching without the patronage of the local ruler, which was easily lost in the midst of impermanent alliances of the ninth century. Similarly, the small number of conversions made by Constantine-Cyril in Khazaria were unconnected to the diplomatic success of procuring prisoners from the ruler of the Khazars. I reached this conclusion by comparing the two hagiographical texts, reading them through the lens of several conversion models. I make use of Richard Bulliet's theory of individual conversion as social conversion. Such a conversion exhibits mundane details, such as relocating to or being accepted by a concrete new community of co-religionists. However, this model is only feasible in a few cases throughout this study, and the historicity of such accounts as described in the texts cannot be attested. Indeed, Karl Morrison's theory of individual conversion as a metaphor rather than a historical conversion is more applicable throughout the text.3 aSuch a lens fits well with the nature of the hagiographical texts, probably written for a Slavic-speaking audience which was already Christian, and not a diplomatic account of Constantine-Cyril's mission. Bulliet's model of group conversion is applicable to the two-hundred Khazars, To determine the extent of conversion, I used Bulliet's model, which stipulates that for conversion to have occurred, there must be a recognition of a spiritual authority, autonomy of the religious authority such as a church having jurisdiction over legal affairs, and a merging of language with religion, during which a liturgical language comes into use. None of this occurs during or following the conversion of the Khazars, indicating that this conversion was not a lasting one. I note a further complication, because several figures that Constantine-Cyril met simply promise to convert, and he simply accepted it. Such promises of conversion occurred where there was initial, but not irremediable hostility of the would-be convert towards Constantine-Cyril. If the group or individual were implacably hostile towards Constantine-Cyril, confrontation and triumph over that group or individual would be the only option. The portrayal of the Khazars as potential converts shifted to a portrayal of the Khazars as irremediable in the time of Methodius's biographer, as the Khazars had become a dangerous enemy to the Byzantine Empire. The hostile tone of Methodius's biographer is visible at several points in the disputation with the Jews as well, leading me to believe that some portions in the disputation were added later. Later interpolations also encompass the linguistic portion of the Life of Constantine, because of the reference to the anachronistic Slavic letters. Similarly, portions of The Life of Methodius appear to have been written later than the late ninth century.3 aThe Life of Constantine contains one thread of continuity, that of the Samaritan and his son converting to Christianity, which foreshadows the hardness of the Jews' hearts during the disputation. I have not dealt with this significance with adequate thoroughness and more research needs to be done on the significance of this contrast. Through the course of my research, I was able to provide some possible answers for these important questions of authorial perspective as well as address my central argument: the conversions in both these texts had no bearing on the diplomatic thrust of imperial missions to the frontier.  aIncludes vita.5FU  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aAdviser: Curta, Florin.5FU  aThis bibliographic record is available under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license.

D.)--University of Florida, 2010.3 aABSTRACT: The characterization of surface roughness is an active area of research with relevance and applications to many fields of sciences and engineering. For example, in geology it is used to infer what type of process gave origin to particular surface morphologies. In hydrology it is used to model surface water runoff. Here the goal is to facilitate the use of active and passive microwave sensors to map soil moisture. For this purpose, surface roughness is considered the random height variations of the soil surface relative to a reference surface. Roughness is thus considered a stationary, single-scale random process characterized by three parameters: the root mean square (RMSh) of the height variations, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and its correlation length (CL). To obtain these parameters the general practice is to record the terrain height variation along two-dimensional (2D) transects using mechanical or non contact profilers. The data from these transects are first detrended to separate the reference surface and the random component, and then the random component is used to compute the roughness parameters.3 aThe current definition and parameterization of surface roughness have the advantages of being simple, but it is generally accepted that the way soil roughness needs to be measured and described for the modeling of microwave phenomena is not yet fully understood. Some practical challenges currently faced include: obtaining precise and accurate roughness parameter values from field instruments and techniques; obtaining measurements that do not contradict the currents assumptions of single scale, isotropy and simple Gaussian or exponential ACFs; obtaining good agreement between soil moisture measurements and the values derived from the microwave models using scattering and or emission observations and in situ roughness measurements. The research hypotheses tested in this work, that explain these limitations are: the existence of systematic and random errors that are not properly accounted for in the measurements; the inadequate practice of using 2D profiles to derive 3D characteristics of the surface; the scaling up of in situ roughness measurements under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. To test these hypotheses, Scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology was employed.3 aLiDAR enables the digitization of surface height variations in three-dimensions (3D) and thus allows for an improved characterization of surface roughness. To address the above mentioned challenges in the characterization of surface roughness with LiDAR technology, a multi-step approach was followed. The first step was to investigate the factors that affect the precision and accuracy of roughness parameterization from 2D measurements. The next step was to analyze and test the current assumptions of roughness characterization following the traditional 2D formulation. This was followed by developing methodologies to characterize roughness from 3D information; that is truly representative of the entire surface. Finally, the issue of scaling was addressed by developing methodologies to use airborne LiDAR to derive millimeter level roughness maps of large areas and to prove the heterogeneity and anisotropy of roughness characteristics over large areas.3 aThe issue of the accuracy and precision of roughness parameters was studied by performing two accuracy assessments and a direct comparison between a meshboard and the ground-based LiDAR. The first accuracy assessment was based on computer generation of random rough surfaces and the second based on measurements employing roughness references. Results indicate that to obtain accurate and repeatable parameter values it is necessary to properly characterize the instrument random errors. The height variation measurements obtained with any instrument are the result of the addition of two random processes: the surface roughness and the instrument random error. If the instrument error is not properly characterized and considered, the computed roughness parameter values will be corrupted and thus inaccurate. Of the parameters, the RMSh is the least sensitive to instrument noise and it was determined that this parameter can be derived from ground-based LiDAR with an accuracy of better than 1mm. The achievable accuracy in retrieving the ACF and associated CL depends on the relative magnitudes of the surface's roughness and the instrument error. Correlation lengths can be accurately determined to better than a cm if the surface RMSh is larger than 1 cm.3 aWith regards to the assumptions used to characterize roughness using the traditional 2D formulation, it was found that agricultural surfaces exhibit multi-scale roughness characteristics. This contradicts the single-scale assumption. However, it is possible to obtain roughness at a particular scale if the proper detrending techniques are applied. It was also determined that the exponential and Gaussian ACF models are just two limiting cases, and that the majority of surfaces have characteristic ACFs intermediate between these two models. In contrast to what has been commonly reported, no correlation was found between the RMSh and CL. However, it was found that at small scales there is a possible negative correlation between RMSh and the maximum observable CL.3 a3D characterization of surfaces of agricultural fields reveals that they are generally even more multi-scale in terms of their roughness than is evident from the 2D formulation. Roughness parameters obtained from the 2D formulation underestimate the characteristics of the surface; by 25% in terms of the RMSh and 30% in terms of the CL. This is because profiles generally do not record the extremes of the surface in a single transect and do not necessary follow the trend of the entire surface. The assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy were proved to not be valid even for small areas. 3D digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from ground-based LiDAR allow for the characterization of roughness with advance tools in the spatial-temporal domain. When the characterization of millimeter level surface roughness of large areas is required, data from high resolution airborne LiDAR can be used. RMSh derived from airborne data was within 1 mm of the RMSh derived from ground-based LiDAR data.3 aIt is expected that the results from this work will motivate a paradigm shift in the way surface roughness data is derived, from a limited sample of in-situ 2D transects to remotely determining 3D roughness of large areas.  aIncludes vita.5FU  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aAdviser: Shrestha, Ramesh L.5FU  aThis bibliographic record is available under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license.

The purpose of this study based on the match-up hypothesis is to examine the effects of race, sport, and expertise of athletes on endorser-product fit, attitudes toward a product, and purchase intentions to a product. Students (N=252) from University of Florida participated in an experiment to test the hypotheses of this study. The findings of this study reveal that the race of an athlete can affect marketing outcomes, depending on the sport with which they are associated. That is, African American basketball athletes showed stronger fit with sports-related products than did Asian basketball athletes, and Asian taekwondo athletes had a more powerful impact on fit with sports-related products than did African American taekwondo athletes, regardless of the expertise level of the endorser. Further, this study also revealed that the fit of the endorser is key to creating both positive consumer attitudes toward a product and purchase intentions. Thus, marketers and promoters can effectively use the results when they choose the best athlete as an endorser for a sport-related product.  aIncludes vita.5FU  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aAdviser: Sagas, Michael B.5FU  aThis bibliographic record is available under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license.

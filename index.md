# metafacture-tutorial

This project is work-in-progress tutorial to Metafacture.

It used to be a selective copy of the [Catmandu tutorial](https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/day-1-getting-catmandu/) but adapted for [Metafacture](https://github.com/metafacture).
The Catmandu tutorial was created by [@phochste](https://github.com/phochste). It is great if you want to learn [Catmandu](https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu). So try it out.

Since [Metafacture Fix](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-fix) is introducing a catmandu-fix like transformation language to Metafacture the adaption of the Catmandu Tutorial for Metafacture purposes seem to me obvious.

It should help you to get accustomed with Metafacture Core and Metafacture Fix.
Have fun.

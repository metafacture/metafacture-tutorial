# metafacture-tutorial

This project is an idea but I have not started yet.

This is a selective copy of the [Catmandu tutorial](https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/day-1-getting-catmandu/) but adapted for [Metafacture](https://github.com/metafacture).
The Catmandu tutorial was created by [@phochste](https://github.com/phochste). It is great if you want to learn [Catmandu](https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu). So try it out.

Since [Metafacture FIX](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-fix) is introducing a catmandu-fix like transformation language to Metafacture the addaption of the Catmandu Tutorial for Metafacture purposes seem to me obvioous.

It should help you to get accostumed with Metafacture Core and Metafacture Fix (sorry, no Metafacture Morph).

Have fun.

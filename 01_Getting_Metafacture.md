## Lesson 1: Introducing Metafacture and requirements for this tutorial

![Logo](https://metafacture.org/img/metafacture.png)
Metafacture is an ETL data processing toolkit with a focus on library metadata.
It was initially developed by DNB starting in 2011 and is maintained since 2019 by hbz.
Metafacture can be used as a stand-alone application or as a Java library in other applications.
The name Metafacture is a portmanteau of the words metadata and manufacture.

In this tutorial we are going to teach how to use Metafacture to peform simple and advanced data processing tasks.

At the beginning we will use the web application [Metafacture Playground](https://metafacture.org/playground/). So no
installation is needed. The Playground is a web interface that helps you getting started.
It is useful to test, share and export metafacture workflows.

Starting with [Chapter 6](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-tutorial/blob/main/06_MetafactureCLI.md)
we switch from using Playground to running Metafacture on our own Hardware.
At this point, to be able to follow the examples, you need a Linux/Unix Bash Shell (part of every Linux, MacOS and Windows >=10)
with Metafacture Core and Metafacture Fix installed.
